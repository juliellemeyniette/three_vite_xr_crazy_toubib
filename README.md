# Project Description

The goal of this project is to get familiar with Augmented and Mixed Reality, Three.js and Vite through the development of a WebXR application inspired by the Operation board game, also known as Docteur Maboul in french, and the VR classic Surgeon Simulator.

Click on the "Start AR" button, find a surface for your phone to detect and tap the screen to spawn the object. Once the object has appeared you can drag it and set it anywhere arround you.
